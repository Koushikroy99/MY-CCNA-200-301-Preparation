# MY-CCNA-200-301-Preparation
I passed my **CCNA 200-301** on **17th March 2025**.  During my preparation, I built several labs on various networking topics using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. These labs helped me understand core networking concepts, and I hope they will help you too in your CCNA journey.
